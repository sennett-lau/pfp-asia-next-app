        The history of blockchain is not long, but we know that with each wave
        comes a brand new narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, each new narrative brings forth new assets. The
        emergence of these new assets is not always easy. A brand-new asset in
        its infancy is often accompanied by numerous challenges and skepticism
        from participants who have experienced the previous cycle.
      </p>
      <p>Isn&apos;t that so?</p>
      <p>
        BTC represents the birth of cryptocurrency. Before their success,
        traditional financial giants chose to ignore them. These old money
        believed that BTC could never surpass gold. They watched from a
        distance, full of disdain and mockery. But now, who has been proven
        wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
        Uniswap, with its AMM mechanism for DEX and DeFi. At that time, TVL,
        vampire attacks, and liquidity pools were not widely known. The miners
        who enjoyed the benefits of PoW chose to mock. They firmly believed that
        CEX and mining farms were the future of everything. But now, who has
        been proven wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
        BAYC and Punk, numerous blue-chip cultural communities, long before
        avatars had multi-million Total Volume. Those who profited from exiting
        DeFi chose to belittle them, calling them &quot;useless pictures.&quot;
        But now, who has been proven wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
        The era of inscriptions created by Ordi. People who dabbled in NFTs
        expressed, &apos;This is just a mark in the stone.&apos; They watched
        countless inscriptions being issued. But now, who has been proven wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
        We are on the verge of an unprecedented Web3 extravaganza. After people
        experience the &apos;empty step&apos; brought by colored glasses, should
        we not understand the new narratives and assets in this cycle in
        advance?
      </p>
      <p>
        We introduced the #REDT protocol in the early stages, which is a
        revolutionary protocol challenging traditional asset concepts. We view
        this innovative protocol, incorporating both fragmentation and
        integration, as the most promising new asset for the next cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a complete object with only single liquidity gains the ability to
        transform granularity at any time, this complete object will
        simultaneously possess both &quot;uniqueness&quot; and
        &quot;liquidity.&quot; When everything in the ecosystem has this
        characteristic, the exchange and transactions between them will
        completely disrupt traditional forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is challenging to compare this new form with existing products in the
        world, just as BTC is similar to gold, Gas Coin on public chains is
        similar to currency, and Tokens are similar to equity and points. This
        universal asset is abstracted as something like &quot;pure ownership
        tokens.&quot; The 10K PFP assets no longer need to issue fungible tokens
        because they are inherently fungible tokens. Similarly, the 21 million
        BTC do not need to issue entirely new NFTs because they are inherently
        NFTs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sounds magical? But this is the impending reality. Seems as unbelievable
        as the impossible triangle? We, too, have felt skeptical in self-doubt.
        Fortunately, our experienced development team has initiated EIP
        proposals and has received incredible attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users of new assets may not necessarily be enthusiasts of old assets.
        Many founders, when launching a project, are eager to find survivors
        from the old era. People often believe in survivors, believing that
        success can be replicated. However, we know that success may be
        inevitable, but each success is always unique.
      </p>
      <p>
        We don&apos;t seek the pity of the behemoths of the previous cycles,
        and, of course, we won&apos;t indulge in self-hype, unilaterally
        praising our own dreams. We simply pay more attention to the path ahead.
        #REDT, as a new asset class, doesn&apos;t just need the favor of Token
        and NFT players. For us, our supporters could come from anywhere, any
        organization, and any background.
      </p>
      <p>
        REDT is not just NFT 2.0. Recently, we welcomed many investors, and
        after they saw our Demo circulating only internally, some leading
        investors praised us, saying they see the potential for OpenSea / Blur
        2.0 in us.
      </p>
      <p>
        We feel both awe and incompleteness. Yes, in a sense, REDT does
        represent a 2.0 form of NFT/FT, but it is more of an entirely new asset
        class. Just as we wouldn&apos;t say NFT is FT 2.0, we also wouldn&apos;t
        say Inscription is NFT 2.0.
      </p>
      <p>We simply know that REDT is REDT.</p>
