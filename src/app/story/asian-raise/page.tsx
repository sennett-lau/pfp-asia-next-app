        2024 is the year about Asian culture is ready to appear in Global NFT
        market, and many Asian culture-themed NFTs are ready to show up to the
        international stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        From my personal view, I highly recommended that everyone can have more
        time on looking how Asian projects perform in 2024 and give Asian
        projects more opportunities to show their leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make a sophisticated decision, find a cultural identity that you
        appreciate, and think how to support it according to your own situation.
      </p>
      <p>The team of PFPAsia has a very deep understanding of Asian culture.</p>
      <p>
        According to the team, the destiny for PFPAsia, is calling all Web3
        player can enjoy our Asian cultures. PFPAsia will do massive works on
        this journey with their artist team, and building the Asia&apos;s most
        iconic PFPs, through the high quality attributes and traits designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This collection use the Asian tradition key-color as the base color
        theme, and learn from many Asian iconic visualized style in social
        media.
      </p>
      <p>
        Including more than 200 men&apos;s and women&apos;s hairstyles,
        thousands of outfits and costumes, more than 100 emotional expressions,
        and also numerous style from different career, traditional or urban
        careers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the design of the attributes, hundreds of Asian legends were
        modernized.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nvuwa also redesigning uniforms according to various traditional Western
        cultures,
      </p>
      <p>such as nuns wearing silk with Chinese traditional patterns...</p>
      <p>
        The most distressing thing for the team is that there has been a
        extremely bear market, particular the NFT market.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even NFTs are for unique and non-fungibles, but majority NFT asset is
        lacks on exclusivity, they blurring the boundaries between different
        standards such as erc721 and erc1155 Sometimes, the only difference
        between NFTs and erc20 is that the minimum unit cannot be lower than 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quality is the basic for PFPAsia. The original vision was to connect
        creators with influential JPEGs, rather than focusing on such as
        &quot;total trading volume,” &quot;mint price,&quot; &quot;market maker
        draw a beautiful line,” Nvuwa will not create a “Shadow Mint&quot;
        strategy with high percentage of control by team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Focusing on solving more important issues, &quot;resource
        allocation&quot;, &quot;collective development&quot;, &quot;fair and
        transparent contributions&quot;, &quot;transition from simple
        speculation to investment&quot;, &quot;not just an economic model, but a
        business model&quot;, &quot;mutual learning and growth&quot;,
        &quot;sustainable and lasting benefits for all stakeholders&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although it&apos;s still a winter for NFTs, it&apos;s not like many
        people said that &quot;NFTs are dead&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, the bad NFTs are died, and the bad people left. Bad management
        gone. But NFTs will never going to die.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PFPAsia team said they still believe this is one of the best
        opportunities to awaken cultural awareness and create brand loyalty.
      </p>
      <p>
        At least for me, NFTs are the best way to manage intellectual-property
        assetswith communities and stakeholder economies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team recognized that a iconic portrait had great potential to build
        a vibrant community. Behind the PFP is a beautiful combination of
        brands, intellectual property (IP), logos, voting rights, income and
        dividends, memberships, luxury goods, art, fashion and even digi-twins.
      </p>
      <p>PFPAsia is here, to make these ideas come true.</p>
      <p>Let&apos;s reveal the artist&apos;s workflow and daily routine.</p>
      <p>
        For example, the AI and HI system. In the Telegram community, there was
        a question about whether Dan uses AI or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, many people have been wondering, because it is very difficult
        for manpower,achieve such a huge workload, If every PFP is totally
        handworks.
      </p>
      <p>
        but AI is impossible to build a decent 10k collection right now. Anyone
        who have tried AI, will understand the unstable results in out of
        control, Can not use them to a 10k PFP project directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even this is challenged, we were moved by the PFPAsia team, They have a
        super high transparency and honesty. In the Telegram community, Nvuwa
        answered these questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        They use their creativity to feed an AI model. And they treat AI as tool
        to inspire them. AI is a mirror, or I say it is a Telescope to observe
        different characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        And that&apos;s just the first step, which will eliminate 94% of the
        original result.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team use multiple tools to improve quality. In this step,
        PFPAsia&apos;s team used about 8 tools to fixing their quality with the
        human eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the third step, they will use hand-drawing, PhotoShop, Adobe
        Illustrator, to do more details. After this, they has more than 10
        optional steps to get the ultimate result they wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why so complex? Nvuwa told us, this is the only way to deal with AI and
        Human Intelligence. A perfect sweet spot. In this market, there are no
        projects are using this method.
